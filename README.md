- 👋 Hi, I’m @Guybru5h
- 👀 I’m interested in share my code
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do it
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything i can
- 📫 I don't know why i take so long on sign in.
- 😃 The only one thing i love more than coding is laughting.
- 👶 Why this looks like a <10 years old introduction? (i swear i left that age decades ago)

+ ⌨️ What about my coding skills?
  + I started learning what programming means with Gamemaker expending several years learning the code basics by trial and error (2007 - 2014).
    - I also learned some C doing some unended game mods.
    + A unsucessfull game released on Android (2016) and later on ported by the editors to Steam (2018) 
      - I didn't see a penny for this that's why i don't put the link however i learned really a lot from this.
  - I decided to study programming at highschool where i learned some Java, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3 && Javascript (2014)
  - I choosen to keep studing Web languages where i learned more HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and PHP (2017)
  +  Currently i didn't work as a programmer, maybe that's why is still funny for me however:
    - I did various management programs for internal use to some companies.
    - I expend my free time doing some coding to keeping me up to date.

+ 🤓 I have knowledge on:
  - The basics of programming of high abstraction.
  - 2D games
  - Interactive Web pages
  - Database management.
  
+ 🤔 I have a lot of interest on:
  - IOT
  - 3D games.
  
+ 😵 I have no idea from where to start with:
  - Machine learning.
  - Blockchain.
  - Bigdata management.

I think i'm done, Where is my lollipop?
